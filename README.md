# Guessing Game
A GitHub Repository for a simple project used to explain the difference in concept between basic, modular &amp; micropython.
The file `basic.py` is a barebones guessing game where the user has to guess between a integral range of 0 to 100, inclusive. The file `gui.py` uses the validation engine from the previous file but makes the app more user friendy as it has a graphical interface. The application has two labels, one textbox, and two buttons. The file `gui.py` was created using the Tkinter module. Lastly, the file `hardware.py` is an implmentation of the same guessing game - but created to interact with various components via GPIO Pins and the machine module. The game requires three buttons and twenty LEDs, 18 of which are used for displaying the user input. The top 9 white LEDs are used for the tens place; consiquently, the lower 9 white LEDs are used for the ones place. The red &amp; blue buttons are used to "type" your guess and the green button is used to submit it. If the blue LED lights up after submitting, the number is higher than your guess. If the red LED lights up, the number is lower than your guess. If both light up and blink, then you guessed correctly! NOTE: The program was made in micropython and created with the Raspberry Pi Pico (non-wireless) in mind.
