# Guessing Game
A GitHub Repository for a simple project used to explain the difference in concept between basic &amp; modular python.
The file `basic.py` is a barebones guessing game where the user has to guess between a integral range of 0 to 100, inclusive. The file `gui.py` uses the validation engine from the previous file but makes the app more user friendy as it has a graphical interface. The applications has two labels, one textbox, and two buttons. The file `gui.py` was created using the Tkinter module.
